## Hey there! Welcome to my page!
Hi! 👋🏾  I’m Tariq Hussain (@tariqchhussain), an enthusastic, self taught, relatively new developer based in Birmingham, UK 🇬🇧!

Find me on these sites!

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tariqchhussain) • [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Riqitch)

### More about me
I love working on Data Science and ML projects, and spend most of my time on Kaggle! If not, then you can usually find me listening to a Data Science/ML/AI podcast (currently going through the DeepMind podcast series), or becoming a sharper programmer on codewars!
#### What are my ambitions?
As a budding Data Scientist/ML Engineer, I would love to expand my arsenal by learning the other languages used within the industry, such as R, Scala and Juila. I would also love to learn C++, C# and C, as well as JavaScript because you can find them everywhere!
#### When I'm not coding...
You can find me keeping up to date with the latest in Science and Technology, playing the guitar, immersed in a good video game or being creative (as if being a developer wasn't creative enough)!

### Skills

- HTML (beginner level)
